#PYGAME PROJ

Hey All,

This is a private github repository to store my school projects. This particular one was created in collaration with two other groupmates.

Description:
A game created using pygame where the map is essentially:
  - a randomly generated maze with object to obtain power ups,
  - enemies to fight with, and
  - move on to the next level by reaching the terminal.
