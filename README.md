Hey All,

This is a private github repository to store my school projects. This particular one was created in collaration with two other groupmates.

A game created using pygame where the map is essentially:
  - a randomly generated maze with object to obtain power ups,
  - enemies to fight with, and
  - move on to the next level by reaching the terminal.

How to Run Game:
You must have pygame pip installed in order to be able to run this pygame base game. Pls have the all game files in the same directory.
